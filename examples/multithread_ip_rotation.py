'''Example: Verifying IP rotation using Tor with the Torsel module.
This script demonstrates how to use the Torsel module to create multiple Tor instances
and verify that the IP address changes for each instance using Selenium.
Important:
- The `collect_ip` function is passed to Torsel and automatically executed for each Tor instance.
- The `driver` is managed internally by Torsel. You do not need to instantiate or manage it.
- The `wait`, `EC`, and `By` parameters are pre-imported and configured by Torsel to simplify interactions with Selenium.
- Both `action_num` and `instance_num` are passed to the function to indicate the specific action and instance being used.
- The `log` function is provided by Torsel for internal logging; you can use it for conditional logging within your function.
- The `max_retries` parameter is used to define how many attempts should be made to retrieve the IP address if the initial attempts fail.'''

    Args:
        driver: Selenium WebDriver instance, passed automatically by Torsel.
        wait: WebDriverWait instance for handling explicit waits.
        EC: Expected Conditions module from Selenium to handle conditions.
        By: Selenium By module used for locating elements.
        action_num: The action number being performed.
        instance_num: The index of the Tor instance being used.
        log: The log function to use for logging messages.
        max_retries: Maximum number of retries if IP retrieval fails (default is 5).
    Notes:
    - The `driver` is pre-configured with the Tor proxy for the given instance.
    - Torsel manages the WebDriver lifecycle, so no need to initialize or close it manually.'''
